# Diabetes Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on medical data. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature selection, and model development using Python.

# Dataset
- Features: Glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, etc.
- Target : Diabetes status (1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic).

# Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Normalize numerical features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Analyze feature distributions.
   - Identify correlations.
3. Model Training:
   - Train models (support vector machine).
   - Optimize hyperparameters.
4. Evaluation:
   - Use metrics like accuracy.
